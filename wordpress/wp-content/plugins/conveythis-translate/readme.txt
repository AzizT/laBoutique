Here is how you can get from the current version of your website to the full benefit multilingual one.

After installation and activation, each line of your site will be translated into the target language with either automatic machine translation or by professional translators. Once you get your pages translated by machine, proceed to “My Translations” dashboard at your ConveyThis Translate account to proofread and edit your translations.
If you want someone else to translate your website, simply grant the access to this person right in your ConveyThis Translate account. This feature is very convenient, especially when you want to translate your website into multiple languages at once and you have multiple people who do the translation for you. You can simultaneously grant access to your co-workers, professional translators, freelancers and apply different roles to each one of them. This is the incredibly powerful combination of both machine translation and human translation.

If you need to delete some of your translated pages (for whatever reason – you checked the analytics of translated page views in your ConveyThis Translate account and found out that this particular page doesn't bring you too much international visits or you just want to change the entire content of this page in your target language), in “My Translations” you can simply do this with one click and your translated word limit will be renewed. As a result you save up some money for more valuable pages to translate, that could bring you more traffic and sales.

**Is ConveyThis Translate free?**

ConveyThis Translate is free for small websites (up to 5000 words).
More features are available on our [advanced plans](https://www.conveythis.com/pricing/). 

Creating a multilingual content is not always fast and easy, especially if you want your customers to be completely satisfied with the accuracy of your translations. Perhaps, you don’t need to choose multiple languages at the first time. You can start with one extra language and translate your site absolutely for free with no limited time usage. Once you realize that you are ready for a multilingual website, you can switch at any time for one of our advanced plans that will help you translate your website into multiple languages. 

Each one of our plans has its own features and benefits. However, even the free plan is good enough to start your multilingual journey and take advantage of multiple benefits, such as free automatic machine translation, SEO optimization, URL translation, analytics dashboard, translation and editing interface. For simple bilingual sites the most simple plan will be enough. As soon as you get more visitor it’s a sign to get a bigger plan. But until this moment the plugin will help you gain them without cutting any benefits.

*Ability to hire professional translators is only available on advanced plans.

**Why is SEO optimization so significant?**

Your multilingual content will be properly indexed by all search engines so you will get an additional (up to 50%) SEO boost.
Most of the traditional plugins give you the ability to translate your website for free and call you to purchase their premium addons to translate page URLs, alt tags for images, add hreflang attributes, etc. ConveyThis Translate works out of the box and gives you all benefits of the multilingual site from the very beginning.

When you translate your pages, you may think that some other benefits will be redundant at the start and don’t take them into account, but translation is only half of the case. It’s not enough to just translate your website to attract the global audience. By adding extra languages to your site you may make your returning customers more loyal, but you will never attract new ones this way. As a result you will get much less benefits from your multilingual website. ConveyThis Translate was built to give you the ultimate translation solution that will help you in gaining international customers without any extra pain.
This is really an all in one translation plugin you may potentially need for your multilingual website. You will never have to deal with testing extra options to choose which one gives you more foreign speaking customers or pay to a SEO expert for consulting. We included the most valuable features into the initial plugin so you will be able to get benefits right from the beginning.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are the minimum installation requirements for ConveyThis? =

* WordPress 4.0 or higher
* PHP version 5.3 or higher

= Can I edit my site's translations? =

Yes, you can edit the translation in your account on the [My Translations](https://www.conveythis.com/dashboard/translation.php "My Translations") tab. All changes will be displayed on your site.

= Will the search engines (Google, Yandex, Bing, etc.) index the translated pages? =

Of course. ConveyThis creates a unique URL-prefix based to the language selected (for example: /ru/ for Russian or /es/ for Spanish), which will be indexed by all search engines.

= Is ConveyThis Translate compatible with my theme/plugin? =

Yes! Where other translation plugins may overcomplicate things, breaking down the translation by theme, plugin, WordPress options (such as blog title and description), and then post and page content all separately, the biggest advantage of ConveyThis Translate is in its simplicity:

When a visitor accesses one of your pages, ConveyThis Translate essentially takes a "snapshot" of all the content, including meta text and other items not directly visible on the page, then uses that text data to retrieve or generate translations. By translating your site's content with this method, you never have to worry about whether changing your theme or adding a new plugin will affect the translated version of your site.

ConveyThis Translate will always be able to translate all the content on your site!

= Why don't my translations appear? =

There are three potential reasons that your translations may not appear on your website:

1. **Your plugin is not setup.** ConveyThis Translate takes only a few seconds to setup, so the first thing to confirm is that your plugin is configured properly. Make sure you select your site's source language (the language your text is currently written in) and then select which languages you want your site to be available in. Make sure you click the save button to complete the setup.
2. **Another script is causing a JavaScript conflict that blocks the plugin from running.** ConveyThis Translate relies on JavaScript to function, and if another plugin throws an error or other exception that prevents the JavaScript from running properly, it may cause issues with the translations being displayed. Try disabling your other plugins one at a time to see if they are causing the conflict.
3. **You have exceeded the limits of your plan.** If you add more languages than your subscription plan supports, or if you exceed the number of words or translations supported by your subscription plan, it may cause the translations to not be displayed on your site. Please view your pages and the plugin's configuration screen when logged in as an administrator and look for any error messages. You can also view your current usage statistics and related data by logging into your user account on [https://www.conveythis.com/](https://www.conveythis.com/)

= Can I bundle ConveyThis Translate with my themes? =

No, you may not bundle the ConveyThis Translate plugin with your themes without express permission.

If you are a WordPress theme developer and would like to provide ConveyThis Translate as a plugin, or have other ideas for integrating ConveyThis Translate into your products, please visit [https://www.conveythis.com/](https://www.conveythis.com/) and contact us to discuss licensing and other issues.

= Why is my text showing as ??????? (question mark characters) =

If the text on your site is displaying as ? (question mark) or square/rectangular symbols, this is typically caused by an encoding issue.

ConveyThis Translate stores translations as UTF-8 encoded string data. To make sure your text is displayed properly, your pages must also be rendered with UTF-8 encoding. This is the standard and default encoding for most WordPress setups, but it is possible to change it. If you think this may be the case, please follow the official WordPress documentation on changing your site's encoding: [https://codex.wordpress.org/Converting\_Database\_Character\_Sets](https://codex.wordpress.org/Converting\_Database\_Character\_Sets)

Also, make sure your theme's template files are save as UTF-8 encoded file types, and that your blog's header is setting the charset value to UTF-8, like so:

&lt;meta charset="UTF-8" /&gt; or &lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"&gt;

= How do I setup my server to separate languages into directories? =

Good news: this requires no additional configuration on your server!

Directory rewriting is a built-in feature that utilizes WordPress's core functionality to automatically prepend the language code to the front of your URL to differentiate your main content from your translated content.

For example, the translated versions of a page located at https://example.blog/my-first-post/ can be accessed from:

* https://example.blog/es/my-first-post/ (Spanish)
* https://example.blog/de/my-first-post/ (German)
* https://example.blog/ru/my-first-post/ (Russian)
* etc.

Make sure that you don't have directories setup on your server with the same name as the language prefixes to avoid any issues with this redirect method. Additionally, make sure that posts, pages, and other content is not setup in WordPress to use the two-letter language code for routing as well. Confirm this with your theme, any other plugins you may be running, and your blog's permalink settings.

= Will ConveyThis slow down my site? =

ConveyThis Translate will not slow down your website as it never needs to access your site's database at any time to translate your site's content!

Unlike other translation plugins such as WPML, Polylang, Loco Translate, and GTranslate, which rely on pulling and saving post, plugin, theme, and other WordPress text from your database, putting lots of additional, unneeded strain on your server, ConveyThis Translate works differently. By scanning each page as it is visited and then retrieving your translations directly from the ConveyThis server--rather than your own--you will never need to worry about optimizing your queries, clearing out old translation revisions, or other database issues. It just works!

= What do I do if I can't find the account confirmation email? =

After you have registered on ConveyThis.com you need to confirm your email address.

Sometimes, you might not be able to find the confirmation email in your main inbox.

Here are some ways to find it:

* Check your Spam/Junk folder.
* Go to the folder "All Mail" if you use Gmail.
* More rarely it might appear in the "Promotions" tab if you use Gmail. You can click on the message and drag it to the Primary tab. Click "Yes" to do this automatically for all future messages from ConveyThis.

If none of the aforementioned helps, please contact our support or use the "Forgot Password" form.

To make sure our emails will reach your inbox in the future you can add our email address to your contacts list. The email address you need is [info@conveythis.com](mailto:info@conveythis.com).

= Why can't I save on the configuration? =

If you cannot set up the API key or select languages on the configuration page, or attempts to translate a page of your website fails, you might be running an outdated version of the plugin. Please update ConveyThis to the latest version.

= How do I update ConveyThis for the latest version? =

If there is a new version of the plugin available, it will appear on the wp-admin panel under the "Dashboard" > "Updates" on the left, as well as under "Plugins" > "Installed Plugins."

**How to update the plugin through WordPress:**

1. Open the list of plugins in your wp-admin panel and find ConveyThis.
2. Below the plugin'ss general information you can see if there are any updates available.

If so, press "Update Now" and the plugin will be automatically updated within the seconds (or press "View version [number] details" and press "Update" from there).

**Download the new version in a .zip archive from the WordPress Plugin Directory.**

1. Go to [https://wordpress.org/plugins/conveythis-translate/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/conveythis-translate/), or type the name of the plugin in search form.
2. Click the "Download" button. The plugin will be downloaded as a zip archive.
3. Go to the Plugins page in your wp-admin and press "Add New", then press "Upload Plugin".
4. Choose the zip file that you just downloaded, upload it, and press "Install Now".

= How do I check the translated segments? =

To find your page's translations you can go to the page "My Translations".

You can find this page by pressing the "ConveyThis" link at the top of your WordPress admin panel and then pressing "Edit My Translations".

You will be redirected to the log-in page of our website. Sign in to your account and go to the "My Translations" tab.

Find and click your website's domain name. That's it! Here are all your translated pages in one place, and also information about the target language and number of page views.

You may access the translations of your website's home page with the short abbreviation of the target language, for example:

/ar/
/ru/
/fr/

All other pages have the same abbreviation at first place and then goes the specific page address of a current page, for example:

/ar/category/finance/loans/
/ru/computers/software/3-ways-to-convert-youtube-videos-to-mov-on-mac/
/fr/category/computers/

= How do I find, edit, and save translated pages? =

Log in to your ConveyThis account and go to the "My Translations" tab.

To edit your translations, first choose domain name you want to edit with and select a specific page address to work on.

Layout of different fragments of the text is categorized as follows:

Page Text: headings, paragraphs, and other text rendered on the page.

Meta Text: page title, description, keywords, and other text not rendered on the page.

Attributes: text in the page body that is not rendered, e.g. title attributes and image alt text.

Here you will see all of your text split up into framgments. To find a specific bit of text, you can copy the first few words of the paragraph you want to edit from your website, then on the My Translations page press Ctrl+F/Cmd+F on your keyboard and paste it the to the search section.

To edit the translations, use the right column labeled "Translations". To save your changes, just press "Save Translations" button at the bottom of this current page.

To delete the entire translation of this language for this page, go back to the previous page and press the "delete" button on the right part of the screen.

= How to find untranslated fragments? =

Sometimes machine translation may miss translating some text. To find the untranslated text, go to the page "My Translations" and choose the specific page you want to edit.

All basic fragments related to this particular page (such as body text, titles, subtitles, etc.) can be found on the tab "Page Text".

Let's say the title of the article was not translated automatically and you need to do it manually. Go to the "Page Text" tab, press Ctrl+F/Cmd+F and paste the title into your browser's search bar.

= Can ConveyThis be run on localhost? =

As of version 2.7 of the plugin, ConveyThis can now be tested from localhost. Previous versions of the plugin will not work on sites hosted locally.

= How long does my account session last? =

When you are editing your translations in your account on our website, you have 24 hours to save your changes before the session expires. When you are on the page "My Translations" page, do not forget to save any changes by pressing the "Save Translations" button at the bottom of the page.

= What number of languages ConveyThis support? =

The number of languages available depends on the plan that you are subscribed to.

With the most advanced "Pro plan" you have 92 languages at your disposal.

So the current amount of the possible languages to operate is 92.

While this list contains all the most-spoken languages of the world, many rare dialects are not yet included.

The plugin can translate not only websites with English language as its source language, but any of the 92 languages available. So whether you are from an English-speaking country or from almost any place of the world, the plugin will work for you.

= Is ConveyThis Translate free? =

ConveyThis Translate is totally free for small websites (under 5,000 words) with one translation language.

Users of paid plans can get their money back within the month of using the plugin you are not satisfied with the result.

= What is Hreflang Attribute? =

According to MOZ experts the "hreflang" attribute (also referred to as rel="alternate" hreflang="x") tells Google which language you are using on a specific page, so the search engine can serve that result to users searching in that language.

Code Sample
<link rel="alternate" href="http://example.com" hreflang="en-us" />

Hreflang attribute allows you to show search engines what the relationship is between web pages in alternate languages. It's useful when you've created content that's specific to a local audience. The hreflang attribute adds a signal to search engines that a user querying in language "x" will want this result instead of a page with similar content in language "y".

Hreflang is a signal, not a directive. That means that other SEO factors may override the hreflang attribute and cause a different version of your page to rank higher. To give search engines the clearest possible signals about which pages are for users in which language, make sure you're using other international SEO best practices.

= Can I migrate from WPML, Polylang or Weglot Translate? =

You can easily migrate from any translation plugin. Just deactivate the current plugin from your wp-admin panel. ConveyThis Translate can then start working properly on your website.

= What are the benefits of ConveyThis work interface? =

From the "My Translations" page you can quickly and easily find any translated page from your website.

If you have thousands of pages, you do not need to remember their titles and get confused, as with similar plugins. Instead, the list of translated page is organized by each page's URL. For example, the Scrybs plugin interface is built in a very convenient way, but all translated pages are sorted by the page title, while the ConveyThis interface sort all translations by the page's URL.

For example:

* /ru/category/product-reviews/
* /az/category/self-improvement/organizing/

= How can I set up / move the language switcher? =

If you want to customize your language switcher, first access the settings page for the plugin in wp-admin and click "Show more options".

You can choose how you want the language switcher displayed: square or round flag; with or without text in it. 

You will be able to place the switcher button either at the top of the right side or at the bottom of the right side of the page. You can also move it to the center of the page or set up the spacing you want using the toggle in section labeled "Indenting".

= How do I resolve "cURL error 7: Failed to connect to api.conveythis.com port 443: Connection refused"? =

Sometimes you may experience the following error:

**[http_request_failed] cURL error 7: Failed to connect to api.conveythis.com port 443: Connection refused**

This usually means that the server cannot connect to api.conveythis.com. Possible reasons could be a firewall or your IP being blocked by ConveyThis.

Port 443 is "https", which your server may not accept. You can try to connect over "http" instead. You can also try to use a proxy server.

If you've tried all of the above and still get this error, contact us at [support@conveythis.com](mailto:support@conveythis.com).

= What do I do if I still need help? =
